        Natural Language Processing, Python, MLOps, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning are among the topics that pique my interest. Also, I'm interested in working as a Machine Learning Engineer. Right now, I am studying about MLOps, Natural Language Processing, and PyTorch. In my spare time, I like to play (and watch) basketball and soccer, learn new languages (currently, I am improving my English and planning to learn Italian!), watch horror and thriller movies, and work on personal projects. Enjoy your stay!

    desc="In this project, we trained a Random Forest, XGBoost, and a BERT model to predict movies' genres based on their descriptions using an IMDb dataset hosted on Kaggle's website. Its main goal was to understand the applicability of the MLflow framework and how to use it to track different models during the training and evaluation steps, while also learning about the model's versioning and registry."

    title="Unsupervised Clustering for Internal Combustion Engines Health Monitoring"
    desc="We present an unsupervised machine learning approach designed to aid in the health monitoring of internal combustion engines, enabling the early detection of possible failures or degradation over time. Our methodology uses temporal data collected from a datalogger device connected to a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics system. This data serves as input for a clustering machine learning model, which is trained incrementally over time to detect anomalies in multivariate time series. The decision-making process to categorize cluster behaviors as anomalies, which might be indicative of engine degradation over time, is based on several key metrics, such as the Jaccard similarity coefficient, relative cluster population, stability, and movement of the centroid over time. The proposed approach is validated on a public rotating machine dataset and tested on an internal combustion engine of a medium-sized vehicle in idle condition."
