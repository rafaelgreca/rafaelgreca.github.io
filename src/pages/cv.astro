      title="Junior Machine Learning Researcher @ CPQD"
      subtitle="April 2022 - Present | Campinas, Brazil · Remote"
    >
    About the company: <a href="https://www.cpqd.com.br/">CPQD</a> is the largest research and development center in Latin America, focused on developing Proof of Concept (PoC) for information and communications technology solutions for a wide range of sectors. <br><br>

    - Developed a deep learning model that raised the accuracy of the existing voice activity detection model by more than 20% and decreased the false positive rate by 12%, improving the quality of the business's speech recognition product. <br>
    - Created a new supervised sentiment analysis model using artificial neural networks, offering useful information about users satisfaction with the client's products. <br>
    - Engineered a novel text classification model that classifies user reviews of the client's products using a tree-based algorithm, offering insightful information to support business decision-making. <br>
    - Designed an unsupervised clustering model that tracks the condition of internal combustion engines over time to identify early failures, which produced a paper submitted to an international automotive engineering symposium. <br>
    - Utilized machine learning and signal processing techniques to implement a C-based solution integrated into Arduino hardware to perform the sound event classification task, achieving near-real-time responses and high accuracy. <br>
    - Created a new supervised machine learning model for the classification of dental prosthesis quality tasks in an Industry 4.0 case scenario, offering insights about production batch quality while aiming to reduce the number of faulty prostheses. <br>
    - Helped and assisted in the development of a machine-learning model to classify sleep stages using only heartbeat data collected via an electronic wristband. <br>
    - Wrote documentation, patents, software registration, and papers of the developed models. <br>
